# pixelEditor
Apologises for the current spaghetti code, we have almost finalised the structure and implementation of the software, and is soon due for a restructuring. 

Features of the software:
  1. Create a blank canvas or import an image of any file format (supports only canvas' up to 800x800 px)
  2. Range of tools: Pen, Eraser, Mirror X, Mirror y, Bucket Fill
  3. Additonal tools for the user: Undo, Redo (still in development), Magnification
  4. Allow for the export of the image after completion in these specific file formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP)

 Plans for current/future development:
   1. Improve the layout and design of the GUI.
   2. Improve the speed for using largeer canvas'
   3. Fix the spaghetti code
   4. Implement more tools, such as Rectangle and Circle Draw, Multiple Layers
   5. More Quality of Improvement, such as key binds for selecting tools, and performing actions.

Thank for checking this out, this our favourite project we have worked on, and has been a great learning experience for software development!
